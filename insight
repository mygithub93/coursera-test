There are 300-400 mappings are being developed. After that let say there are few session properties needs to be changed(client's requirement).
Normally, we put more resources each changing certain number of mapping so that work can be completed ASAP. The same thing can be done in following ways.
1.export the XML of all mappings at once.
2.write a macro in excel that will run through the exported xml file. Using a Regex it will find the specific session properties and replace it with required properties value.
3.Re import the XML and you are done.
A work that would require certain number of resources and days can be done 20-30 minutes.
